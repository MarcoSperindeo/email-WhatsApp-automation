# email-WhatsApp-automation
## Why?
The main goal of this project is to overcome the limitations coming from the fact that WhatsApp is a closed system that does not expose an API available for public use.
This is done by scripting the browser's user interface of WhatsApp Web client using Python's 'pyautogui' package.
The script allows also to automate sending of emails via Python's 'smtplib' module.

## How?
Feed a list of contacts to the .py script via a .csv file and automate in bulk sending of emails and/or WhatsApp messages.
Follow the 'user_guide.pdf' file in the 'files' folder of the project for further instructions on how to use the program.
