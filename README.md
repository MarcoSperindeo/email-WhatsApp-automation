# email-WhatsApp-automation
## Why?
The main goal of this project is to overocme the limitations coming from the fact that WhatsApp is a closed system that does not expose an API available for public use.
This is done by scripting the user interface of WhatsApp Web client browser using Python's 'pyautogui' package.
The script allows also to automate sending of emails via Python's 'smtplib' module.

## How?
Feed a list of contacts to the script via a .csv file and automate in bulk sending of emails and/or WhatsApp messages.
